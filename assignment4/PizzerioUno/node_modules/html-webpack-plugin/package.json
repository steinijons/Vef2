This is especially useful for `webpack` bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply\nyour own template using `lodash` templates or use your own loader.\n\n### `Plugins`\n\nThe `html-webpack-plugin` provides [hooks](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#events) to extend it to your needs. There are already some really powerful plugins which can be integrated with zero configuration\n\n * [webpack-subresource-integrity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-subresource-integrity) for enhanced asset security\n * [appcache-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/lettertwo/appcache-webpack-plugin) for iOS and Android offline usage\n * [favicons-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin) which generates favicons and icons for iOS, Android and desktop browsers\n * [html-webpack-harddisk-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-harddisk-plugin) can be used to always write to disk the html file, useful when webpack-dev-server / HMR are being used\n * [html-webpack-inline-source-plugin](https://github.com/DustinJackson/html-webpack-inline-source-plugin) to inline your assets in the resulting HTML file\n * [html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin](https://github.com/thegc/html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin) to inline SVGs in the resulting HTML file.\n * [html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin](https://github.com/jamesjieye/html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin) for excluding assets using regular expressions\n * [html-webpack-include-assets-plugin](https://github.com/jharris4/html-webpack-include-assets-plugin) for including lists of js or css file paths (such as those copied by the copy-webpack-plugin).\n * [script-ext-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/numical/script-ext-html-webpack-plugin) to add `async`, `defer` or `module` attributes to your`<script>` elements, or even in-line them\n * [style-ext-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/numical/style-ext-html-webpack-plugin) to convert your `<link>`s to external stylesheets into `<style>` elements containing internal CSS\n * [resource-hints-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/resource-hints-webpack-plugin) to add resource hints for faster initial page loads using `<link rel='preload'>` and `<link rel='prefetch'>`\n * [preload-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/preload-webpack-plugin) for automatically wiring up asynchronous (and other types) of JavaScript chunks using `<link rel='preload'>` helping with lazy-loading\n * [link-media-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/yaycmyk/link-media-html-webpack-plugin) allows for injected stylesheet `<link />` tags to have their media attribute set automatically; useful for providing specific desktop/mobile/print etc. stylesheets that the browser will conditionally download\n * [inline-chunk-manifest-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jouni-kantola/inline-chunk-manifest-html-webpack-plugin) for inlining webpack's chunk manifest. Default extracts manifest and inlines in `<head>`.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\nThe plugin will generate an HTML5 file for you that includes all your `webpack`\nbundles in the body using `script` tags. Just add the plugin to your `webpack`\nconfig as follows:\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nconst HTMLPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: 'index.js',\n  output: {\n    path: __dirname + '/dist',\n    filename: 'index_bundle.js'\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new HTMLPlugin()\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis will generate a file `dist/index.html` containing the following\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Webpack App</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <script src=\"index_bundle.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIf you have multiple `webpack` entry points, they will all be included with `script` tags in the generated HTML.\n\nIf you have any CSS assets in webpack's output (for example, CSS extracted with the [ExtractTextPlugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin))\nthen these will be included with `<link>` tags in the HTML head.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Options</h2>\n\nYou can pass a hash of configuration options to `html-webpack-plugin`.\nAllowed values are as follows\n\n|Name|Type|Default|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:-----:|:----------|\n|**[`title`](#)**|`{String}`|``|The title to use for the generated HTML document|\n|**[`filename`](#)**|`{String}`|`'index.html'`|The file to write the HTML to. Defaults to `index.html`. You can specify a subdirectory here too (eg: `assets/admin.html`)|\n|**[`template`](#)**|`{String}`|``|`webpack` require path to the template. Please see the [docs](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-webpack-plugin/blob/master/docs/template-option.md) for details|\n|**[`inject`](#)**|`{Boolean\\|String}`|`true`|`true \\|\\| 'head' \\|\\| 'body' \\|\\| false` Inject all assets into the given `template` or `templateContent`. When passing `true` or `'body'` all javascript resources will be placed at the bottom of the body element. `'head'` will place the scripts in the head element|\n|**[`favicon`](#)**|`{String}`|``|Adds the given favicon path to the output HTML|\n|**[`minify`](#)**|`{Boolean\\|Object}`|`true`|Pass [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier#options-quick-reference)'s options as object to minify the output|\n|**[`hash`](#)**|`{Boolean}`|`false`|If `true` then append a unique `webpack` compilation hash to all included scripts and CSS files. This is useful for cache busting|\n|**[`cache`](#)**|`{Boolean}`|`true`|Emit the file only if it was changed|\n|**[`showErrors`](#)**|`{Boolean}`|`true`|Errors details will be written into the HTML page|\n|**[`chunks`](#)**|`{?}`|`?`|Allows you to add only some chunks (e.g only the unit-test chunk)|\n|**[`chunksSortMode`](#plugins)**|`{String/|Function}`|`auto`|Allows to control how chunks should be sorted before they are included to the HTML. Allowed values are `'none' | 'auto' | 'dependency' | 'manual' | {Function}`|\n|**[`excludeChunks`](#)**|`{String}`|``|Allows you to skip some chunks (e.g don't add the unit-test chunk)|\n|**[`xhtml`](#)**|`{Boolean}`|`false`|If `true` render the `link` tags as self-closing (XHTML compliant)|\n\nHere's an example webpack config illustrating how to use these options\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\n{\n  entry: 'index.js',\n  output: {\n    path: __dirname + '/dist',\n    filename: 'index_bundle.js'\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new HTMLPlugin({\n      title: 'My App',\n      filename: 'assets/admin.html'\n    })\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### `Generating Multiple HTML Files`\n\nTo generate more than one HTML file, declare the plugin more than\nonce in your plugins array\n\n**webpack.confg.js**\n```js\n{\n  entry: 'index.js',\n  output: {\n    path: __dirname + '/dist',\n    filename: 'index_bundle.js'\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new HTMLPlugin(), // Generates default index.html\n    new HTMLPlugin({  // Also generate a test.html\n      filename: 'test.html',\n      template: 'src/assets/test.html'\n    })\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### `Writing Your Own Templates`\n\nIf the default generated HTML doesn't meet your needs you can supply\nyour own template. The easiest way is to use the `template` option and pass a custom HTML file.\nThe html-webpack-plugin will automatically inject all necessary CSS, JS, manifest\nand favicon files into the markup.\n\n```js\nplugins: [\n  new HTMLPlugin({\n    title: 'Custom template',\n    // Load a custom template (lodash by default see the FAQ for details)\n    template: 'index.html'\n  })\n]\n```\n\n**index.html**\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\"/>\n    <title><%= htmlWebpackPlugin.options.title %></title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIf you already have a template loader, you can use it to parse the template.\nPlease note that this will also happen if you specifiy the html-loader and use `.html` file as template.\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nmodule: {\n  loaders: [\n    { test: /\\.hbs$/, loader: \"handlebars\" }\n  ]\n},\nplugins: [\n  new HTMLPlugin({\n    title: 'Custom template using Handlebars',\n    template: 'index.hbs'\n  })\n]\n```\n\nYou can use the `lodash` syntax out of the box. If the `inject` feature doesn't fit your needs and you want full control over the asset placement use the [default template](https://github.com/jaketrent/html-webpack-template/blob/86f285d5c790a6c15263f5cc50fd666d51f974fd/index.html) of the [html-webpack-template project](https://github.com/jaketrent/html-webpack-template) as a starting point for writing your own.\n\nThe following variables are available in the template:\n- `htmlWebpackPlugin`: data specific to this plugin\n  - `htmlWebpackPlugin.files`: a massaged representation of the\n    `assetsByChunkName` attribute of webpack's [stats](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/node.js-api#stats)\n    object. It contains a mapping from entry point name to the bundle filename, eg:\n    ```json\n    \"htmlWebpackPlugin\": {\n      \"files\": {\n        \"css\": [ \"main.css\" ],\n        \"js\": [ \"assets/head_bundle.js\", \"assets/main_bundle.js\"],\n        \"chunks\": {\n          \"head\": {\n            \"entry\": \"assets/head_bundle.js\",\n            \"css\": [ \"main.css\" ]\n          },\n          \"main\": {\n            \"entry\": \"assets/main_bundle.js\",\n            \"css\": []\n          },\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    If you've set a publicPath in your webpack config this will be reflected\n    correctly in this assets hash.\n\n  - `htmlWebpackPlugin.options`: the options hash that was passed to\n     the plugin. In addition to the options actually used by this plugin,\n     you can use this hash to pass arbitrary data through to your template.\n\n- `webpack`: the webpack [stats](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/node.js-api#stats)\n  object. Note that this is the stats object as it was at the time the HTML template\n  was emitted and as such may not have the full set of stats that are available\n  after the webpack run is complete.\n\n- `webpackConfig`: the webpack configuration that was used for this compilation. This\n  can be used, for example, to get the `publicPath` (`webpackConfig.output.publicPath`).\n\n\n### `Filtering Chunks`\n\nTo include only certain chunks you can limit the chunks being used\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nplugins: [\n  new HTMLPlugin({\n    chunks: ['app']\n  })\n]\n```\n\nIt is also possible to exclude certain chunks by setting the `excludeChunks` option\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nplugins: [\n  new HTMLPlugin({\n    excludeChunks: [ 'dev-helper' ]\n  })\n]\n```\n\n### `Events`\n\nTo allow other [plugins](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/plugins) to alter the HTML this plugin executes the following events:\n\n#### `Sync`\n\n* `html-webpack-plugin-alter-chunks`\n\n#### `Async`\n\n* `html-webpack-plugin-before-html-generation`\n* `html-webpack-plugin-before-html-processing`\n* `html-webpack-plugin-alter-asset-tags`\n* `html-webpack-plugin-after-html-processing`\n* `html-webpack-plugin-after-emit`\n\nExample implementation: [html-webpack-harddisk-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-harddisk-plugin)\n\n**plugin.js**\n```js\nfunction MyPlugin(options) {\n  // Configure your plugin with options...\n}\n\nMyPlugin.prototype.apply = function (compiler) {\n  compiler.plugin('compilation', (compilation) => {\n    console.log('The compiler is starting a new compilation...');\n\n    compilation.plugin(\n      'html-webpack-plugin-before-html-processing',\n      (data, cb) => {\n        data.html += 'The Magic Footer'\n\n        cb(null, data)\n      }\n    )\n  })\n}\n\nmodule.exports = MyPlugin\n```\n\n**webpack.config.js**\n```js\nplugins: [\n  new MyPlugin({ options: '' })\n]\n```\n\nNote that the callback must be passed the htmlPluginData in order to pass this onto any other plugins listening on the same `html-webpack-plugin-before-html-processing` event\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contribution</h2>\n\nYou're free to contribute to this project by submitting [issues](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-webpack-plugin/issues) and/or [pull requests](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-webpack-plugin/pulls).
